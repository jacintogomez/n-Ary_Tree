# n-Ary_Tree

This program allows the user to visualize data for n-ary tree of chosen size. The user enters n (the number of children per node) and b, the max number of
nodes they want displayed. The program will output, for nodes 1-b, the index of the parent of that node, and the indices of the children of that node.
